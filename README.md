# MediaFingerprint
Media intent triggered by your fingerprint sensor.

## Why

Some times, when I'm commuting, I want to be able to skip or pause my music without taking my phone from my pocket. That's why. I only tested it with my phone, and with my music player (spotify).

## Limitations

This rely on accessibility service to listen to fingerprint gestures. That have some limitations:

- [Google does not like us using it](https://www.androidcentral.com/android-accessibility-services)
- It needs the screen to be on, to be used.
- It overrides the "system" gesture for notifications.
- It needs to be disabled from the settings to stop.

## Contribution
